booklet idea with nav tabs using alpine.js and tailwind

<!-- The idea of ​​this code was to make a light and simple application on the web page.

The application allows you to put content on the canvas and create an internal navigation menu on the same page. I also used the $persist apline plugin to allow the user to reload the page and not lose the table of contents they were in.. -->
